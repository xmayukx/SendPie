# SendPie

**The next generation food delivery app, with focus on efficiency and sustainability**


## Concept

**People are busy and always having the need to go from one place to another, on our way, don't we always get past some food shop or the other?
What if we made it so, that we could add one more purpose to our journey, and that is to deliver food from the place we are departing 
to the destination we are headed at, reducing the fuel costs, saving fuel and effort which is often spent by delivery boys who are having 
one single purpose, to only deliver. SendPie enables anyone to take care of the delivery of food commodities, enabling efficiency and 
adding a side income for regular people.**
